### Discord Bot for the ROTN Discord Server

This is a .NET Core console application that uses [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net).

You have to create a .txt file named "token.txt" and have it contain the bot's secret token for this to work.

Once the bot is added to the discord server and the console app is running, you will see the bot come online. Then you can type "/help" to get a list of commands.
